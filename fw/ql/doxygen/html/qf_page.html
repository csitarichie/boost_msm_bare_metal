<p>Quantum Frameowrk&trade; (QF) is a reusable event-driven application framework for executing concurrent state machines specifically designed for real-time embedded (RTE) systems. The use of <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF services.">QF</a> generally simplifies the design of event-driven software by allowing the application to be divided into multiple active objects that the framework manages. Active objects in QF are encapsulated tasks (each embedding a state machine and an event queue) that communicate with one another asynchronously by sending and receiving events. Within an active object, events are processed sequentially in a run-to-completion (RTC) fashion, while QF encapsulates all the details of thread-safe event exchange and queuing.</p>
<p>Most of QF&trade; is written in portable ANSI-C, with microprocessor-specific, compiler-specific, or op-erating system-specific code kept to a minimum for ease of portability. QF is designed to work with Quantum Event Processor (QEP) and a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) of your choice, or even with just "main+ISRs" configuration. The framework is very compact, typically taking up about 4KB of code and data (including the <a class="el" href="qep_page.html">QEP Hierarchical Event Processor</a>). QF has been used in hundreds of event-driven applications worldwide and is described in Part 2 of the book <a class="el" href="index.html#PSiCC2">Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition</a>, Newnes 2008.</p>
